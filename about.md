  Just another Australian developer, attempting to make his way in the world.
</h3>

By day I handle the customer support for a small software company here in the Gold Coast. Both at work, and in my personal life, I find myself having to find software solutions to various problems. This blog I aim to share some of these solutions with my readers, and to highlight some of the work I&#8217;ve done as well.

Feel free to get in contact with my directly using the form above if you happen to have any questions about any of my work.
