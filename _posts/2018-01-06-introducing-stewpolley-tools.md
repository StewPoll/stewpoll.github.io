As mentioned in my &#8220;[year in review](http://stewpolley.local/2018/01/02/2017-year-in-review/)&#8221; post, I mentioned wanting to release tools that others may find useful in their day to day lives.

I am glad to say that today marks the start of that, with [https://tools.stewpolley.com/](https://tools.stewpolley.com) going live today. My first tool I&#8217;m calling &#8220;Timezone Aligner&#8221; &#8211; It&#8217;s the same as many other tools out there, I can hardly take credit for an original design. The other tools out there didn&#8217;t suit my needs though. Living in Queensland (AEST), we don&#8217;t have Daylight savings. Many of the other Timezone converters out there don&#8217;t take this into account, and when you try to convert Australian Eastern Standard Time to Central Standard Time, if the other Australian states are observing Daylight savings, you simply couldn&#8217;t get these other tools to work.

This tool takes this into account, and I like to think it&#8217;s a nice clean interface. I&#8217;m not a front end designer though, so feel free to tell me I&#8217;m wrong about that!
