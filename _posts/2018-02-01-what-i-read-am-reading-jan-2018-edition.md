Welcome to the first monthly edition of my &#8220;What I&#8217;m reading&#8221; series. Click here to read other posts in this series.

I&#8217;ve been compiling this list throughout January, and the following links appear in the chronological order of when I read them. Unlike my &#8220;Year in review&#8221; post, I&#8217;ll be posting links toÂ _what I read_ this month, not to things that were published this month.

Without further ado, here&#8217;s my reading list for Jan 2018.

  * [Bug Bounty Guide](https://bugbountyguide.com/): Tips for Bug Hunters and Product Owners alike on how to hunt for bugs, and how to operate a bug bounty system.
  * [Everything you need to know about HTTP security headers](https://blog.appcanary.com/2017/http-security-headers.html): A run down on the different HTTP security headers you can use, what they do, and instructions on how to set them in a number of frameworks/servers
  * [Accessibility Checklist](https://github.com/irekrog/accessibility-checklist/blob/master/README.md): A look at making sure your web-pages are designed in a way to allow those with accessibility needs can easily navigate your site.
  * [Android UI Automation](https://slack.engineering/android-ui-automation-part-1-building-trust-de3deb1c5995?source=rss----58820b6d8904---4): This series by the Slack Engineering team is an interesting look into how they get their UI testing done, and why they feel it&#8217;s valuable.
  * [Outsmarting Icognito Detection](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/disabling-browser-incognito-check-cc84288e89b3): Sites are trying to force you to not use incognito, so they can track you. This post looks at one way of how to get around that.
  * [xkcd: Meltdown and Spectre](https://xkcd.com/1938/): One of the shortest and easiest to understand summaries of the whole Meltdown/Spectre incident.
  * [Setting up a DNS Firewall on Steroids](https://navytitanium.github.io/DNSMasterChef/): Something I want to do in the future.

Hopefully you find one, or all of these a good, worthwhile read.
