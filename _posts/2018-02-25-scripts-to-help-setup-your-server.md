Setting up your server to be correctly configured to accept traffic and proxy it back to the correct applications can be difficult at times.

Ok it&#8217;s not really _that_ difficult, especially with [Digital ocean providing lovely guides](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials) for free on basicaly&#8230; anything!

But these can take time to get setup, which is why a number of automated tools exist. Mainly for a learning excercise for myself, I wanted to build my own automation to get the type of servers I was commonly using quickly set up, to help improve my own productivity.

So far I&#8217;ve written two main scripts, but will expand on these in time:

  * LEMP stack setup
  * WordPress install

You can view the detailed instructions for these scripts at https://scripts.stewpolley.com/ and [view the source code on github](https://github.com/StewPoll/deploy-scripts).
