Hopefully you've enjoyed reading my posts, but you may be wanting to get more! I'd love to post more often, but here's a simple list of some other authors that I find useful and informative.

## Individual Bloggers

Here's some specific individuals who's blogs I follow, and find useful.

### [**Troy Hunt**](https://www.troyhunt.com/)  
Troy focuses on teaching developers designing their applications in a secure manner, offering courses on Security-by-design etc. His blog offers an insight into some simple ways you can help keep your websites and apps secure, from a code point of view as well as some infrastructure help. He also runs the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) service, and so offers a unique perspective on Data Breaches and privacy issues resulting from mass collection of data by companies.

### [**Scott Helme**](https://scotthelme.co.uk/)
Scott is a UK based Security researcher, looking primarily at different ways of keeping the content of your website secure. Scott runs the [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.io/) service, and with the help of Troy Hunt, also runs [Reports URI](https://report-uri.com/)**,** which helps websites monitor Content-Security-Policy issues.

### [**Lars Klint**](https://larsklint.com/)
Lars is a freelance developer based in Australia. He has a large number of Pluralsight courses available, and is an advocate for HTTPS Everywhere.

### [**Michal Spacek**](https://www.michalspacek.com/) 
I've only recently come across Michal, but I've been enjoying his content and hope to see more of his work in the future.

## Organisation Blogs

Sometimes, it's not an individual person who writes an article, but a group of people. Here's some companies whose blogs I also find worthwhile reading.

### [**Paragonie**](https://paragonie.com/blog) 
I really wish I could put this one under &#8220;Individuals&#8221; as I'd like to link to [Scott Arciszewski's](https://twitter.com/ciphpercoder) personal blog, but he does it all through his employer. That's absolutely fine though as even the articles he doesn't write are still great to read too. Paragon release a number of great articles looking at security and cryptography, primarily with PHP in mind.

### [**Slack's Engineering Blog**](https://slack.engineering/) 
Slack's Engineering blog offer a great insight into what it takes to build and run one of the largest chat platforms in the world (if not the largest&#8230;)
